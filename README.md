CETLI.VIM
=========

A work in progress for my own use for handling notes aka my Zettelkasten.
Designed around using pandoc markdown and
[bibtexcite.vim](https://github.com/ferdinandyb/bibtexcite.vim).


```
σχίδη (gr.) → cedula (l.) → zedel (ger.) → Zettel (ger.)
                 ↓                              ↓
              cédula (hu.)                 cetli (hu.)
```
shortened etymology from [wikitionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cetli)


Inspiration
===========

Michal Hoftich's [vim-zettel](https://github.com/michal-h21/vim-zettel) was
pretty awesome, I copied quite a few things from there, but because it is
a vimwiki add-on it was too heavy for me, with baggage from the vimwiki syntax
carried over to markdown.

[notational-fzf-vim](https://github.com/alok/notational-fzf-vim) powers much of
the search, but I needed the ability for separate search commands for separate
folders.
