CETLI.VIM
=========

A work in progress for my own use for handling notes aka my Zettelkasten.
Designed around using pandoc markdown and
[bibtexcite.vim](https://github.com/ferdinandyb/bibtexcite.vim).


```
σχίδη (gr.) -> cedula (l.) -> zedel (ger.) -> Zettel (ger.)
                 |                              |
                 ˇ                              ˇ
               cédula (hu.)                   cetli (hu.)
```
shortened etymology from [wikitionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cetli)


Inspiration
===========

Michal Hoftich's [vim-zettel](https://github.com/michal-h21/vim-zettel) was
pretty awesome, I copied quite a few things from there, but because it is
a vimwiki add-on it was too heavy for me, with baggage from the vimwiki syntax
carried over to markdown
